# DDoS Detection Using Machine Learning on CICDDoS2019 Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements and compares multiple machine learning models for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using the CICDDoS2019 dataset.

##  Files Included

- `ML_Model_CICDDoS_Updated.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of 13 ML models for DDoS detection.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions.

##  Models Implemented

- Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- AdaBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Logistic Regression
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Naive Bayes
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

##  Features

- Preprocessing (Label Encoding, Normalization)
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score analysis

##  Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy

To install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DDOS-Detection-ML.git
cd ddos-detection-ml-models-cicddos2019
